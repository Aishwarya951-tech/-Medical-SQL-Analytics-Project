# -Medical-SQL-Analytics-Project
A hands-on SQL analytics project using a simulated medical database. It includes complex queries on patients, doctors, and admissions to extract insights, track trends, calculate BMI, and build reports using joins, aggregations, and conditional logic.


This project demonstrates practical SQL skills on a simulated healthcare system involving:

Tables: patients, doctors, admissions, province_names

Technologies: MySQL, ER Diagram, SQL Joins, Aggregation Functions, Subqueries

** Features:**
 Time-based analytics: count admissions by day, year, or by diagnosis

Diagnosis insights: identify frequent diagnoses and repeat admissions

 Doctor-patient linkage: explore specialty-based and name-based associations

 Calculated fields: generate obesity flags using BMI, create secure temp passwords

 Regional trends: summarize patient counts and metrics by province or city

 Reporting queries: show unique values, popular fields, role-based lists
